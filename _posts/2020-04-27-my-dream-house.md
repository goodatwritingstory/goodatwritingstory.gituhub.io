I first thought of living in a mansion so big, but then I knew if I was that rich people would know where I lived. So I got an idea I am going to build a small cabin, but the cool stuff will be underground it is going to have 

 

1. Arcade

2. Ice skating rink

3. Theater 

4. Video game room

5. 102 inch tv

6. Swimming pool

7. Hot tub

8. Toys

9. Secret passageway 

10. super awesome bed

 

I hope it comes true. If you like my post, please do tell your friends and family about it and follow me in twitter @goodwritings1
